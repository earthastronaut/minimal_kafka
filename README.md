# Minimal Kafka

An example of getting Kafka running with as few pieces as possible. Useful for small projects prior to scaling to large (more resilient) deployments. 


Based on [Confluent's all-in-one](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/5.5.0-post/cp-all-in-one-community/docker-compose.yml) without added services.
